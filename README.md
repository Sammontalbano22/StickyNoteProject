The Sticky Note That Changed My Life!
Growing up, I always knew I wanted to go to college. I was captivated by the idea of learning from world-class resources and being part of a community that was dedicated to growth. But I also knew the path wouldn’t be easy—college is expensive, and navigating the road to higher education takes more than just ambition.

At the start of my freshman year of high school, I made two long-term goals:

To have options when choosing a university

To attend college on a full-ride scholarship

These were bold dreams. Less than 1% of students earn a full-ride scholarship, and I was well aware of the odds. But that awareness didn’t discourage me—it pushed me. For the first time in my life, I wrote a goal down. On a small 3x3 sticky note, I wrote: “I will be a Daniels Fund Scholar.” The Daniels Fund is a prestigious full-ride scholarship program in the Southwestern United States, and I stuck that note right next to my bed.

That sticky note became my compass. On days when I felt motivated, I’d look at it and feel a surge of purpose. And on days when I felt like doing nothing at all, I’d still see it. It reminded me that taking even one small step toward my goal was still progress. It taught me that showing up, consistently, is its own kind of victory.

My junior year of high school tested that belief. I suffered a traumatic injury that forced me to miss a significant amount of school. When I returned, I felt like a shadow of my former self. But the sticky note was still there. It reminded me why I needed to keep going. Even if all I could do was show up to class, that was still a step.

After four years of steady, intentional effort—bit by bit, day by day—I received the life-changing news: I had been selected as a Daniels Fund Scholar. I had earned a full-ride scholarship to study at a university of my choice. That moment will remain one of the most vivid memories of my life. I walked over to the sticky note and, with pride and overwhelming gratitude, crossed it off. That little square of paper became a symbol of resilience, discipline, and unwavering self-belief.

Anyone who has ever set a New Year’s resolution only to give up weeks later knows the truth: long-term goals are hard. In a world of instant gratification, it's difficult to keep striving when the results aren’t immediate. Long-term success demands consistency, habits, and faith in the process.

That’s why, for my senior design project—an independent study through the Computer Science department at the University of Denver—I’m developing an app inspired by this experience. The app will help users set and stay accountable to their long-term goals, using motivation techniques like habit tracking, reflective prompts, milestone celebrations, and even a virtual progress counselor. My hope is to make long-term goals feel achievable by breaking them down into small day by day goals.
